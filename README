Build the executable running: make
Clean the files using: make clean

Execute the program using: ./lighting

Controls: 

Camera: Click and hold left mouse and drag around.

Increase Wind: Page up, page down
Change wind direction: Home/End Buttons

To Do:

Right now I have a basic particle system to represent the wind. The windmills can 
spin at seperate speeds based on the radius of the blades.

* Need to change particle system orientation based on wind direction
    - Maybe clean it up a little so that it stands out better in the scene
      and also increase the speed or volume of particles when speed is increased

* Retexture the skybox, right now uses the thunderbirds one

* Limit camera rotation to above ground

* Implement way to record the energy output per turbine

* Add foliage. Have some tree and rock models I'd like to use

* Permanent light system. I don't want the light orbiting the scene unless you
    want it to

* Blade feathering. THis should be easy, just a rotation when conditions are met.

* Finish blade implementation
    * Stop at wind max speed / and feather

* Click on turbine to get info?

* Shadows if I can get to it in time

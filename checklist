I plan to continue with/expand significantly on the scene I have developed on 
the previous assignments. Currently I have a basic scene of wind turbines 
spinning at uniform rates. 

To expand on this, I want to be able to let the user control the wind speed and
see the result of this change through the change in spin speed of the turbines.
I'll scale the max spin speed relative to the size of the windmill and handle 
turning off/on the windmills if the wind speed reaches dangerous levels or become
to light for the windmills to generate power. Still brainstorming ideas, but I intend
to demo the energy being produced through the turbines by either a series of lights 
growing brighter/dimmer, or a small town being lit. I'm open to suggestions on this,
but I want a way to see how the wind speed affects all of this. Maybe users can add 
windmills to see the effect?

To expand on the scene, I'll maybe add moving cars, trees or other things to populate 
the area. Mostly just to give it a more full appearance. 

Stretch Goals:

*Terrain map with some turbines located on hills. Maybe wind higher at greater elevation?

*Can find details on wind turbines online, and find a good way to present information to 
the user about different model turbines? (Power, size, max speeds, weight, etc.)

- Then maybe different models will perform differently in similar wind conditions

*Open to other suggestions? Seems it would be fairly simple to add complexity to this project
	eg. Show airflow as particles, etc.


*To Do*

Wind Turbines
-	Move Lighting calls to it's own init function
-	Can texturing be refactored to it's own function?
-	Change shape of windmill blades
-	Add windmill blade feathering functionality
-	Change Gearbox to rounded cylinder shape
-	Turbines rotate y axis dependant on wind direction/user input
-	Rotation speed of wings is relative to wind speed
-	To high speed invokes feathering functionality
-	Energy of each turbine needs to be managed
		- Structure for each turbine with energy attributes 	
	Stretch:
		-	User places turbines
		-	Direction placed has effect on energy produces (normal of windflow?)
		-	Include different models of turbines and their max energy outputs
Air
-	Add visibility of airflow through scene - Fog Perhaps?
-	User has control over wind speed / direction
-	Click and drag to create wind source (length of drag)

Energy Brainstorming
-	Perhaps on user click of turbine, display current energy being produced
-	Display totals to user on sidebar, broken down by each turbine
-	Demo energy being stored and consumed by power source (Light, etc.)

Scene
-	Add skybox
-	Add moving traffic/foliage, etc. to fill scene
-	Add terrain map, if we can get to it, this will affect wind speed

Light
-	Sun source? Maybe moves slowly? 
-	Incorporate shadows into scene - turbines first and foremost
